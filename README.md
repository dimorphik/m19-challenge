## Module 19 Challenge

For my solution to the Module 19 challenge, I used the following responsive breakpoints:

- **small** (mobile): max-width = **767px**
- **medium** (tablet): min-width = **768px**, max-width = **1265px**
- **large** (desktop): min-width = **1266px**

GitHub does not seem to support opening links in a new tab! So, if you want to keep this repo open:

**CTRL+click (on Windows)** or **CMD+click (on Mac)** to view the current code [live on GitHub Pages](https://dimorphik.github.io/m19-challenge/).
